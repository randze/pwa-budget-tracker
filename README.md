## Installation
1. Cloning the repo
2. npm install
3. Run "node server.js"

## How it works
- Add positive/negative entries
- Will post to MongoDB if theres a connection
- If offline will post to local indexDB
- Once theres a connection again will bulk post saved entries to the database and wipe the indexDB

## Improvements to be done
- Refactoring code
